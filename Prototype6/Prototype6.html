    <p>For our final prototype, we took the line graph and stacked each attribute on top of each other to show their combined values. This helps to get a different perspective of the data by showing the relationship between each attribute more. However with this visualization it is more difficult to see the similarities years have for the same attribute, especially for intrumentalness and energy. </p>
