    <p>Similar to the first prototype, the third variation of the scatter plot graphs uses a single graph and colour encodings to represent the different song attributes. However, the size of the data point is used to represent the song rank instead of colour luminance. While area is an encoding that is more challenging to decipher for ordinal data types, it makes the trends slightly more recognizable than the first prototype. The dotted vertical lines also assist in distinguishing the different decades.
