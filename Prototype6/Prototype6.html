    <p>For our final prototype, a stacked area graph was created by summing the attributes of each year to show their combined values. By stacking the data, the relationship between attributes is also highlighted and provides a different perspective than the other prototypes. However, it is more difficult to see the trends years for the same attribute, especially for intrumentalness and energy, due to its reliance on the stack of data underneath.</p>
