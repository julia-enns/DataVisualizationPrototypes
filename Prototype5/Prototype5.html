    <p>TThe fifth prototype is similar to the fourth, but displays the data using area instead of a single line. This aids in showing the values of each attribute more strongly than the previous prototype does. Since the areas of each attribute are translucent, each attribute is visible despite overlapping. Since the overlap distorts the colours, a legend which shows the colours when overlapping was also added to improve the clarity.
