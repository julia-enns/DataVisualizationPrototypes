    <p>The fifth prototype is very similar to the fourth one other than displaying the information with area rather than a single line. This helps to show the values of each attribute more strongly than the previous prototype does. As well, the areas of each attribute have some transparency to them so every piece of data is shown clearly visible and overlapping is not an issue.
