    <p>The first prototype shows the relationship between the song attributes and the year the song was released. It uses colour encodings to represent the energy, instrumentalness, and valence attributes, indicated by the legend to the right of the visualization. The legend also shows that the colour luminance of the data point represents the rank of the song in the year it was released. Since the rank is ordinal, luminance was a good candidate to represent the data.
